Stacks and queues are defined by their behavior — in other words, how items are added to and removed from them:


| Stacks |  Queues |
| --- | --- | 
|Operate on “last-in, first-out” (aka, LIFO) behavior. The last, most recently added item, is the first to be removed.	|Operate on “first-in, first-out” (aka, FIFO) behavior. Items are removed in the order they were added, from first to last.|
